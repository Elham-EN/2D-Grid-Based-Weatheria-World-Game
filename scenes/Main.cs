// GAME OVERVIEW:
// This creates a grid-based building placement system - like tower defense games
// Player moves mouse -> cursor snaps to grid -> click to place buildings
// Core mechanics: cursor tracking + building placement + grid alignment

    // GAME OBJECTS WE NEED TO CONTROL:
    // Visual cursor that shows where we'll place buildings
    private Sprite2D sprite;
    // Template/blueprint for creating new buildings
    private PackedScene buildingScene;

        // Step 2: Convert pixels to grid coordinates
        // Divide by 64 because each grid cell is 64x64 pixels
        // Our world is divided into 64Ã—64 pixel squares. This math tells us 
        // "which grid square is the mouse in?" For example, pixel (250, 180) 
        // becomes grid (3.9, 2.8).
        var gridPosition = mousePosition / 64;
        // Snap to Whole Grid Numbers: (3.9, 2.8) becomes (3, 2)
